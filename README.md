Folder /base contains the setup of the forward and inverse problem, including all necessary binaries.
Code PT_GAN.py starts %Nchain parallel chains and creates %Nchain copies of the \base folder to run paralel calculations.
Code sem2d_read_fault.py reads SEM2DPACK outputs, original can be found at (https://github.com/jpampuero/sem2dpack)
